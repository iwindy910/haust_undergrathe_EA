# EATTACK

This is a project on adversarial attacks on speaker recognition systems, which also includes some attacks on Baidu ASR and iFlytek ASR. The experimental assumptions are consistent with SMACK, with the emotion embedding generation model being FG-transformer-TTS. The noise optimization utilizes an improved VLPSO. Lastly, the implementation of the ALIF algorithm on FastSpeech2 is also included.
